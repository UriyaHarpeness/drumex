The Distances will use global offset and does not need to be attached to any group.

There will be a class called NotationContainer which will contain a vector of NotationContainer, this will be an
abstract class, and classes like GroupedNotation will derive from it.
Notes in the same location, grouped notes, polyrhythmic notes and all will derive from it.
This may also enable making every bar a group, as well as notation multiple levels of beams or polyrhythms without
collisions.

All the variation and generally all steps until presenting needs to use the global locations map, after that the voices
will be split and further to bars and connected notes.

Need to think a little more on specific details, maybe first design the classes and flow before going to implementation.
