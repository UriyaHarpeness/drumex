## General Info

#### Notation Structure

DrumEX sees notation in the following hierarchy (lowest to highest):
1)  Single Note - Contains the instrument, length, and modifiers.
2)  Note Group - Gathers multiple notes with same length that are played simultaneously.
3)  Voice - Contains a list of all the note groups that belong to the same voice.
4)  Notation - Contains multiple voices, and represents the full and final structure.

#### Time

1)  The note value is always a power of 2, since all the notes
    are composed of these powers.
